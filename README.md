 I created a Node.js Backend project

 npm init -y 

 This created package.json to manage dependencies.

 npm install express mongoose  
npm install --save-dev nodemon



I designed Two MongoDB Schemas using Mongoose:
 MoviesLike.js — to store user likes for movies.
 MovieRating.js — to store user ratings for movies.



 I created Two APIs using Express:
 One API to add Like for a movie 
 One API to add Rating for a movie 




 I created 2 schemas and 2 APIs:
 Like a Movie
 Rate a Movie
